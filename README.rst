datatest: Testing tools for data preparation
********************************************

Datatest extends the Python standard library's unittest package to
provide testing tools for asserting data correctness.

* Documentation:
    - http://datatest.readthedocs.io/en/0.6.0.dev1/ (current release)
    - http://datatest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (unstable)
* Official Releases: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datatest
* Development: https://github.com/shawnbrown/datatest

Datatest can help prepare messy data that needs to be cleaned,
integrated, formatted, and verified. It can provide structure for the
tidying process, automate checklists, log discrepancies, and measure
progress.

.. note::
    This is a pre-1.0.0 release that is under active development (see
    `Future Plans`_ for more information).


Installation
============

The easiest way to install datatest is to use pip::

  pip install datatest


Stuntman Mike
-------------

If you need bug-fixes or features that are not available in the
current official release, you can "pip install" the *unstable*
development version directly from GitHub::

  pip install --upgrade https://github.com/shawnbrown/datatest/archive/master.zip

All of the usual caveats of a bleeding-edge install should apply here.
Only use an unstable development version if you can risk some
instability or if you know exactly what you're doing. While care is
taken to never break the build, it can happen.


Safety-first Clyde
------------------

If you need to review and test packages before installing, you can
install datatest manually.

Download the latest **source** distribution from the Python Package
Index (PyPI):

  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datatest

Unpack the file (replacing X.Y.Z with the appropriate version number)
and review the source code::

  tar xvfz datatest-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

Change to the unpacked directory and run the tests::

  cd datatest-X.Y.Z
  python setup.py test

Don't worry if some of the tests are skipped.  Tests for optional data
sources (like pandas DataFrames or MS Excel files) are skipped when the
related third-party packages are not installed.

If the source code and test results are satisfactory, install the
package::

  python setup.py install


Supported Versions
==================

Tested on Python versions 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 2.7 and 2.6.
Datatest is pure Python and is likely to run on PyPy, Jython, and other
implementations without issues (check with "setup.py test" before
installing).


Future Plans
============

I'm aiming to release a 1.0.0, stable API by the end of the year. But
before this happens, I want to get some feedback, add support for more
data sources, and improve py.test integration (including a py.test
plugin).

As I tighten the integration with unittest and py.test, expect some
assertions and properties to be renamed.  But don't panic---test suites
that rely on the current version's assertion names (version 0.6.0.dev1)
will still run by adding the following import to the beginning of each
file::

    from datatest.__past__ import api_dev1

This said, all of the data used at the `National Committee for an
Effective Congress <http://ncec.org/about>`_ has been checked with
datatest for more than a year so there is, already, an existing codebase
that relies on current features and must be maintained into the future.
It is my intention that the API only change in measured and sustainable
ways.


Dependencies
============

There are no hard dependencies. But if you want to interface with pandas
DataFrames, MS Excel workbooks, or other optional data sources, you will
need to install the relevant third-party packages (``pandas``, ``xlrd``,
etc.).
